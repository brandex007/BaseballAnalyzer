# BaseballAnalyzer
Analyze baseball stats using fan graphs, based on league settings, and produce csv sheet with rankings.

(Requires replacing batting2018preseason.csv and pitching2018preseason.csv) with up to date data from fangraphs)

Creates batting2018preseason2.csv and pitching2018preason2.csv file, which then contain a 'ranking' category that you can sort to find the best projected players (lower number ranking = better player)

The application works by simply importing csv files, finding the average ranking for each player, and creating new csv files. 

WORK IN PROGRESS.. works but is in alpha alpha

Enjoy! :D
